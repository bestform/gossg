First things first: I love Ableton Live. Whenever I need an example of a great software product I mention Ableton Live as a glowing example. Live is a software with a clear vision which it executes perfectly.

Having said that this is my story of switching DAWs.

## History

I started making music on an Amiga500 using dMusic and trackers. When I switched to PC I soon found a new love in Propellerheads Reason. Reason was the first kind of pricey software I bought in store after working for a month during my summer break. It was glorious.

I upgraded Reason for several versions (I lived through the times of propellerheads experimentation with the "record" software and even bought a reason+record upgrade, which I still have in box on my shelf).

But as much as I loved Reason I felt the need for some better way to compose and experiment.
So I checked out Ableton Live and instantly fell in love. At first I used it in conjunction with Reason to overcome its limitations and just used the best of both worlds.

But as time went by I completely switched to Ableton Live and never looked back. I loved everything about this software and while I kept experimenting with different tools (mainly puredata and renoise), my main DAW has been Live ever since.

## My musical style

I have always been heavily into sound design. This was a major part in almost every genre I was experimenting with - namely EDM, Glitch, Trip-Hop, Hip-Hop, LoFi. 

Recently I moved on to Space Ambient and Techno/Dub Ambient.

For all those genres, Ableton Live was perfect and I kept updating my Live version to the latest Suite version over the years. My current Ableton Live version is the latest version 12.

## The Plugin story

I am a musician by night and software developer by day, so in recent years money became less of a limited resource than time, so I started to invest in some Plugins.

I started with the classic Serum and soon found joy in professional Plugins like Arturia Pigments, Pro-Q3, Pro-R2, you name it. The usual suspects in the field of sound design and professional FX. I even bought a current version of Reason to use as a Rack Plugin inside Ableton Live.

So my focus shifted from just investing in the DAW of choice to buying tools that work independently of the chosen host. 

## Max4Live

As a programmer, the integration of Max/MSP into Live was like a dream come true. Having a history in puredata this was the perfect match. 

But as powerful this integration was I found myself using it almost never. I don't know (or didn't know - more on that later) why, because it seemed to have been made just for me. 

An unbelievably powerful tool with an excellent integration into the DAW. A whole world of possibilities. And yet I rarely used it. Which is a real shame. I still regret not investing more time into it. 

But that said: I deeply respect Ableton for this move, because on paper it is the perfect addition to Live. So powerful. So flexible. It is just awesome.

## The switch to Bitwig Studio

To be honest, I dismissed Bitwig for the longest time. It felt like a toy by some talented people who had a vision that just wasn't there, yet. And I think that has been true for the first years of its existence, but I cannot say for sure, because I didn't give it a try. The UI felt very cheap and uninspiring, the features were lacking and I just didn't trust it to rival Live in any way whatsoever.

But about a month ago I felt the need for a new approach to music making. I was kind of stuck in Live and felt a little limited working with it. I don't know why this feeling was growing inside me. I suspect that my deeper focus on sound design due to my work in the Ambient space just left me with the feeling that the DAW could do more for me than just being a host for some great Plugins. 

Whatever it may have been, I remembered that there was this DAW that I dismissed all those years but that obviously has been releasing update after update and I thought to myself: "It couldn't hurt to just try it. There is a 30 days trial after all. I have nothing to lose!"

So I installed the Bitwig trial and something strange happened. Immediately I was more productive in Bitwig than I have ever been in Live. Everything seemed to be tailored to my way of thinking. I didn't even read a lot of documentation. I just started to make music and it all made so much sense.

After some time it became clear to me what separated Bitwig from Live, but in the beginning it just seemed magical. 

## What separates Bitwig from Live

This is the part where we dive into sub categories, so bear with me.

### The Layout

Bitwig is very similar to Live. The two modes of composing - the scene view and the arranger - are  on par with Live. This is not a big thing as the concept is obvious and there is not much that can be improved. Or is there?

Well, there is. The way Bitwig provides the scene view in conjunction with the arranger might seem like a small thing at first, but it makes a huge difference for me.

To be able to experiment with new ideas while still working mainly with an arrangement side by side is so helpful. In combination with the fact that Bitwig adjusts the length of clips dragged into the arrangement to fit the longest loop might seem to be a small thing, but it is so useful and it is one of many small things that tell me: the developers thought about this aspect and made it better. This is how it should work. 

But this is just one example of many small things I appreciate about the design of Bitwig.

### The Modulators

Oh. My. God. The modulators.

Let me be clear: there is nothing in here that cannot be done in Live. But: having a set of modulators for every instrument or track or project that is super easy to access is a dream come true. 

Sure, you can add an LFO to a track in Live and map its values to all possible controls - including all parameters of a Plugin. But the way Bitwig does it is just so unbelievably seamless, you don't have to think for a second to automate anything with a modulator.

This opens up so many possibilities. Having an audio sidechain modulator on the project modulators and just map it to a tool on each track is so much easier than setting up the same thing in Live. It is possible in Live and it would have the same effect. But it would be so much more involved. In Bitwig it's just two clicks and it works.

Modulating some parameters of my Plugin is often times easier to do with modulators than it is in the Plugin itself. And that includes synths like Pigments which has an excellent way of automating parameters inside the Plugin.

### The Grid

Let's talk about the elephant in the room. I mentioned before that I adore Max4Live. But at the same time - for whatever reason - I rarely used it.

Enter The Grid: I use it ALL THE TIME. For anything. I use the Note Grid to generate sequences. I use the FX Grid to build whacky effects. I use the Multi Grid to design crazy sounds. And I am having the time of my life. 

So why does this tool mean so much more to me than Max4Live? 

To reiterate: Max4Live is perfect. On paper. It does everything and can integrate with Live through an API that rivals anything I know of. 

The Grid doesn't do that. It is way more limited. But it turns out that this seems to be its strength. It knows exactly what it needs to be. It is super easy to use and has the perfect amount of abstraction - which is a very difficult task. The Grid just works.

I would love for The Grid to provide an option to design user interfaces. But at the same time I am not really sure whether that would take away from its strength. Because while I adore Max4Live for its integration into the UI of Live, I suspect that this power might be a factor that is holding it back from being a tool that you just whip out for some quick experimentation. 

Speaking as a software developer: you can always add more features and more flexibility but there is a point where you are hurting yourself and your users with this kind of flexibility and power. And Bitwig is in a pretty great place on this spectrum. 

## The Note Generator Story

I love using note generators. My favorite VSTs in this space are Devicemeister Stepic and Harmony Bloom.

To use those in Live you need to put them on a separate track from the synth you want them to control and set the track with the synth to receive midi notes from the track the generator is on. And you need to set its monitoring to "In". This is not a big deal but it feels so needlessly cumbersome.

In Bitwig it works just as you would expect: just put the generator in front of the synth. Done. This is a big deal for me and my workflow.

But to be honest: while I love this way of working with midi generators, since discovering the Note Grid I often just create my sequences in the Grid. That doesn't mean I don't use my favorite tools anymore, but it means that I use them way less. To a point that even if it was as cumbersome in Bitwig as it is in Live I still would choose Bitwig because the Note Grid is so powerful and easy to use.

## Verdict

The thing that separates Bitwig from Live seems to be that the developers of Bitwig have a love for sound design and workflow. They always ask themselves "how would I want this to work for my way of music making?". 

I don't want to dismiss the work Ableton does, and - as I said - things like Max4Live are a clear proof that they know what they are doing. But at the same time I think that Ableton is concentrating too much on the programmer way of thinking and not so much about the musician.

One would think that this is exactly what I am looking for as a programmer myself. But when I am making music I want to make music. And Bitwig caters to that way of thinking more than Live does. It is all about tradeoffs - in programming and in music making. And I think that Bitwig struck this balance way better than Live did.

## Final words

Produce great music in whatever DAW you prefer. At the end of the day it does not matter. For me it turned out that Bitwig is my way forward. If for you Live or Logic or Reaper or whatever else is better suited: go for it! Just make great music. A DAW is just a tool. Choose the one that suites you and your workflow best. 

For me it apparently is Bitwig. Who would have guessed. I did not. But here we are.
